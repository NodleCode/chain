<h3 id="overview" class="section-header"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>The Recovery pallet is an M-of-N social recovery tool for users to gain
access to their accounts if the private key or other authentication mechanism
is lost. Through this pallet, a user is able to make calls on-behalf-of another
account which they have recovered. The recovery process is protected by trusted
“friends” whom the original account owner chooses. A threshold (M) out of N
friends are needed to give another account access to the recoverable account.</p>
<h4 id="recovery-configuration" class="section-header"><a href="#recovery-configuration">Recovery Configuration</a></h4>
<p>The recovery process for each recoverable account can be configured by the account owner.
They are able to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>friends</code> - The list of friends that the account owner trusts to protect the recovery process
for their account.</li>
<li><code>threshold</code> - The number of friends that need to approve a recovery process for the account to
be successfully recovered.</li>
<li><code>delay_period</code> - The minimum number of blocks after the beginning of the recovery process that
need to pass before the account can be successfully recovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a configurable deposit that all users need to pay to create a recovery
configuration. This deposit is composed of a base deposit plus a multiplier for
the number of friends chosen. This deposit is returned in full when the account
owner removes their recovery configuration.</p>
<h4 id="recovery-life-cycle" class="section-header"><a href="#recovery-life-cycle">Recovery Life Cycle</a></h4>
<p>The intended life cycle of a successful recovery takes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The account owner calls <code>create_recovery</code> to set up a recovery configuration
for their account.</li>
<li>At some later time, the account owner loses access to their account and wants
to recover it. Likely, they will need to create a new account and fund it with
enough balance to support the transaction fees and the deposit for the
recovery process.</li>
<li>Using this new account, they call <code>initiate_recovery</code>.</li>
<li>Then the account owner would contact their configured friends to vouch for
the recovery attempt. The account owner would provide their old account id
and the new account id, and friends would call <code>vouch_recovery</code> with those
parameters.</li>
<li>Once a threshold number of friends have vouched for the recovery attempt,
the account owner needs to wait until the delay period has passed, starting
when they initiated the recovery process.</li>
<li>Now the account owner is able to call <code>claim_recovery</code>, which subsequently
allows them to call <code>as_recovered</code> and directly make calls on-behalf-of the lost
account.</li>
<li>Using the now recovered account, the account owner can call <code>close_recovery</code>
on the recovery process they opened, reclaiming the recovery deposit they
placed.</li>
<li>Then the account owner should then call <code>remove_recovery</code> to remove the recovery
configuration on the recovered account and reclaim the recovery configuration
deposit they placed.</li>
<li>Using <code>as_recovered</code>, the account owner is able to call any other pallets
to clean up their state and reclaim any reserved or locked funds. They
can then transfer all funds from the recovered account to the new account.</li>
<li>When the recovered account becomes reaped (i.e. its free and reserved
balance drops to zero), the final recovery link is removed.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="malicious-recovery-attempts" class="section-header"><a href="#malicious-recovery-attempts">Malicious Recovery Attempts</a></h4>
<p>Initializing a the recovery process for a recoverable account is open and
permissionless. However, the recovery deposit is an economic deterrent that
should disincentivize would-be attackers from trying to maliciously recover
accounts.</p>
<p>The recovery deposit can always be claimed by the account which is trying to
to be recovered. In the case of a malicious recovery attempt, the account
owner who still has access to their account can claim the deposit and
essentially punish the malicious user.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the malicious recovery attempt can only be successful if the
attacker is also able to get enough friends to vouch for the recovery attempt.
In the case where the account owner prevents a malicious recovery process,
this pallet makes it near-zero cost to re-configure the recovery settings and
remove/replace friends who are acting inappropriately.</p>
<h4 id="safety-considerations" class="section-header"><a href="#safety-considerations">Safety Considerations</a></h4>
<p>It is important to note that this is a powerful pallet that can compromise the
security of an account if used incorrectly. Some recommended practices for users
of this pallet are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure a significant <code>delay_period</code> for your recovery process: As long as you have access
to your recoverable account, you need only check the blockchain once every <code>delay_period</code>
blocks to ensure that no recovery attempt is successful against your account. Using off-chain
notification systems can help with this, but ultimately, setting a large <code>delay_period</code> means
that even the most skilled attacker will need to wait this long before they can access your
account.</li>
<li>Use a high threshold of approvals: Setting a value of 1 for the threshold means that any of
your friends would be able to recover your account. They would simply need to start a recovery
process and approve their own process. Similarly, a threshold of 2 would mean that any 2
friends could work together to gain access to your account. The only way to prevent against
these kinds of attacks is to choose a high threshold of approvals and select from a diverse
friend group that would not be able to reasonably coordinate with one another.</li>
<li>Reset your configuration over time: Since the entire deposit of creating a recovery
configuration is returned to the user, the only cost of updating your recovery configuration
is the transaction fees for the calls. Thus, it is strongly encouraged to regularly update
your recovery configuration as your life changes and your relationship with new and existing
friends change as well.</li>
